# About the Healthwise platform
The Healthwise API Platform follows RESTful design patterns and features JSON responses. The APIs are designed according to 
REST architectural principles:
- APIs are organized as resources
- HTTP verbs are used correctly
- APIs follow the principles of HATEOAS

# Security
Our APIs use the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework for security. Your Healthwise account manager will assist you in setting up access to the Healthwise API solution and obtaining a client ID and secret. For more information, refer to the [Authorization API](/api/authorization).
